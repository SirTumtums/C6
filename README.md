# C6. Challenge Six: Weather Man

## Description 
This app was created to help users look up the weather for the next five days and plan for the week. This is done so by implenting the OpenWeather API with our own CSS and HTML. 

## Usage
Simply enter a city by name and hit the search button. The app will save your searches in local storage as to cut down time by not having to retype common locations.
